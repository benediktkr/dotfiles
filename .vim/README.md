# `.vim/`

Colorschemes:

 * `everforest`: [`sainhe/everforest`](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest/)
   * The colorscheme also has themes for `airline` and `lightline`, which
   im not using, so i kept copies of the rest of the files in `.vim/everforest`.

## vim with Lars

* `airline`: shows on the bottom if you are in insert-mode or normal-mode
* switching between normal-mode and insert-mode constantly/often is normal and the right way to use vim
* indent markers, `indent-line` is the plugin and file `.vim/plugin/indent-line.vim`.

Lars says most of what i want is in `lrn-care-yadm/.vim/plugin/sets.vim`
  * relative line numbers
  * `ColorColumn` is there, tahts what sets the char limit marker

Theme Lars uses `onedark` theme with `background=dark`:
  * `colors.vim`
